Overview:
The content of written feedback differs considerably; high-quality feedback can collect a significant amount of valuable votes from the audience over time. The freshness of the review is an essential quality attribute, and a model that correctly forecasts the amount of valuable votes that the written review would earn in the future that bring considerable commercial benefit to businesses. Knowing the value of the analysis in advance, companies may offer high-quality, fresh feedback to their clients to obtain insight into their goods and services. It is particularly difficult to predict the usefulness of the review due to the scarcity of labelled data, with only less than 10% of the reviews released. The Yelp data set has a large usefulness measure (more than three available votes). Furthermore, unlike sentimental research, where positive and negative sentimental words play an significant role in the process of classification, there are no apparent features that explicitly indicate the utility of the text.

Problem Statement:
•	We discuss the outcomes of the test, and allows us the chance to vote for funding. If the consumer wishes to do so, he or she can upvote or downvote a comment to his or her helpfulness. For eg, 3/5 would mean that three participants believed that the research was beneficial in thinking otherwise. There may be a number of people who have read the analysis but have not expressed their opinions.
•	We solve the problem by posing it as a matter of classification. Analysis is labelled as "helpful" or "unhelpful;" instead, different algorithms predict labels. Here we're going to use the Random Forest Bag-of-Words as a reference. In addition, we analyzed the basic RNN and LSTM tests and compared the results.
•		It is important to consider how users view product reviews as they may include insight about what affects buying choices of the customer. We address this topic by the study of the data and the certainty of its usefulness. We continue to use deep learning frameworks such as RNN and LSTM as a binary classification problem.

Objective
•	The preliminary objective is Learning the reviews received by the consumer gives us the consistency of the review and allows us to identify the most valuable comments from the widely accessible feedback. These online reviews are a fantastic tool for us to determine whether or not to go for the Product.
•	Prediction of helpfulness is done by the LSTM a Recurrent neural network trained by using the backpropagation which overcomes the gradient problem

Frameworks provides a framework for development of software. This allows it easy for web-based computer programmers to create reliable, practical and workable enterprise-wide mobile apps. Automate the delivery of repetitive tasks or modifications for different operations, increase development time and test time, and enable programmers to concentrate more on code logic instead of daily work.
Python framework classified as two types:

1.	Full-Stack System
Full-stack solutions offer comprehensive resources to engineers, including essential elements such as structural clearance, device generators and program architecture.
•	django
•	flask
•	turboGears
•	zope2
•	cubicWeb
•	grok
•	pylon

2.	Non Full Stack
 
a.	Non full stack applications do not offer additional features and highlights to customers. Designers have to provide a variety of coding and other things manually.
b.	Micro Frame work
•	Miniaturized scale systems are the lightweight , compact and quick to operate. They are laconic, and they have clear paperwork. URL forwarding is often a full networking process. Miniaturized scale systems using WSGI which run via HTTP request or response. We are a reasonable option for small undertakings or part of the larger undertaking.
•	cherryPy
•	flask
•	bottle
•	pyramid
•	bobo



c.	Asynchronous Framework

In cases where the level of demand involves a large amount of research or an project needs lengthy periods of response, a non-concurrent solution would be efficient.


We have agreed to use the Flash Microframework for our e-Voting program.

Flask is a lightweight, simple-to-use web application platform for Python WSGI. It is developed to allow fast and easy launch, with the potential to scale to complicated applications. It began as a simple tool and jinja wrapper, and turned out to be one of the most-Python web application frameworks.
This is perceived as more Pythonic than the Django web framework on the ground because, in comparable situations, the same Flash operating program is quite succinct.
 
Flask gives recommendations, but does not meet with the conditions or specifications of the product. It's up to the developer to pick the devices and resources they choose to use. There are several network extensions that make up the network, including a simple new feature.
Apps that utilize the Flask program include Pinterest Facebook and the Flask Community website itself.
Important features that make up the microframework of our Choosing microframework

•	Simple to start
•	No Boilerplate code required
•	built-in development server and quick debugger
•	offers usability, versatility and fine-grained power.
•	Design of Jinja2
